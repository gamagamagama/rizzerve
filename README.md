The Treasure-Backed Staking System is a decentralized application where users stake custom tokens to earn simulated rewards, with those rewards dynamically linked to the performance of real-world and Crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, and the S&P 500. Users begin by connecting their wallets using Web3 tools (Wagmi + RainbowKit or Web3Modal), then purchase project tokens using ETH. That ETH is simulated as being redistributed into a diversified "treasury" portfolio made up of these real-world and Crypto assets.

Once users hold the token, they can lock it in a staking contract for a specified time period. The longer the lock duration—or the higher the wallet balance—the greater the simulated yield, mimicking real-world reward dynamics. Meanwhile, the app continuously visualizes how the treasury backing (funded by ETH) would fluctuate based on historical or real-time asset data. Users can simulate market conditions—like a Bitcoin crash or a gold surge—and see how those events affect the backing value of their staked tokens.

This system blends DeFi mechanics with educational simulation, showing users how token value and staking rewards could be influenced by broader market trends. Built with Scaffold-ETH 2, it includes wallet connection, custom ERC20 token, staking, minting, volatility correction etc... contracts, and an interactive frontend with charts, yield forecasts, and treasury visualizations, creating a complete and intuitive experience that bridges crypto and real-world asset behavior.
